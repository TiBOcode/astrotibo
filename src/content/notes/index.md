 You're at the gates of a maze where Music, Life, and everything in between collide in the most beautiful way. This is where we break the rules, embrace creativity, and learn.

### Before you step in, here's the deal:

1. All content here is 100% free. Yep, you read that right.
2. This isn't your average website. It's a non-linear website designed to make learning feel like play.
3. Is it a Maze... or is it a Guide? It's a Maze that lets your own curiosity be the guide! There's "no right or wrong" here 

If you want to learn more, click here to [explore why non linear website makes learning more efficient](/notes/nonlinear). One Simple Rule: Just let your curiosity and interest guide you from clicks to clicks until you find your way back home.
