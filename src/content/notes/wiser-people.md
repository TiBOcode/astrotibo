When I was young(er) I remember feeling like older people's advices on life were a bit irrelevant to me... and it wasn't just me because most of my peers grew up with this idea too! 

Many cultures have immense respect for the elderly, but much of the world now values youth, innovation, and change, often at the expense of the wisdom and experience of older generations. But somehow, everything changed when I began traveling by bike, encountering countless older people along the way.

# The Challenge of Intergenerational Dialogue

The dialogue between generations has always been a tricky one. It‚Äôs messy, it‚Äôs awkward, and it often feels like both sides are speaking entirely different languages. Rarely do you find an authentic exchange where both sides truly understand each other. But somewhere along my journey, I learned how to bridge that gap.

Older people tend to be forgotten, left out of conversations as the values, desires, and interests of the younger generation grow bigger. It's true, I wouldn't ask an elderly person for advice on how to manage this website. But there‚Äôs a wealth of knowledge and experience they hold, waiting for the right questions to unfold.

# Show them respect and they'll open up

The first lesson I learned is that respect is the key. Older people are incredibly sensitive to how much respect you show them. If they feel valued, they‚Äôll share insights and stories that you would never have expected.

I realized that by simply listening and showing genuine interest in their experiences, I could access this wisdom. Making me in turn want to connect with them even more. I wanted their perspectives on life, relationships, and challenges that they went through.

# Everyone's unique Life

"Meeting people where they are to understand who they are" 

üìù[This is exactly why I chose to travel by bicycle](/notes/why-by-bike) I'll eventually write more about this topic.
