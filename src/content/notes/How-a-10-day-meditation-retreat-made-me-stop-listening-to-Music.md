description: This is a story about how I've gradually stopped listening to music in my daily life. People are generally very surprise by that considering how much I love playing and teaching Music. Somehow I started loving it even more by listening to it much less.

### 
The breakthrough happened in March 2024, I left the Vipassana center in the Swiss Mountains, I had just spent 10 days meditating for about 10-12 hours a day, not allowed to talk nor do anything else than meditating. After saying goodbye to the people I shared the silent experience with, I jumped on the bike to continue my adventure and it started with a "simple 5km downhill" which I'll remember my whole life. I don't know what I expected after 10 days without no stimulation beyond my own thoughts but going downhill on my little bike fully loaded turned from routine to complete ecstasy at the overwhelming amount of sensations I experienced. The cold wind on my face, the pressure of my hands holding the handlebar, the feeling of the pedals on my feet and the amazing landscape moving so fast around me all merged into one conscious stream of thoughts.

### Meditating made me more sensible 
I didn't feel anything the same, everything felt bigger, louder, more intense and beautiful. Eventually, the night came and the day ended wild camping in the cold Swiss mountains: I was feeling great. Somehow, I started playing some relaxing music on my phone only to suddenly stop it a few minutes later, to my own surprise. Why? Because it felt like noise to me, it was distracting me. Even that soft, instrumental music, which I previously loved using to Focus & Write felt like a distraction. The beats, rhythms, and melodies would pull my mind away from the calm, focused state that I was having without it.

### The best moments of Clarity and Creativity come in the Silence
Music is undeniably powerful. It can shift our mood, energize us, or bring us to tears and For years, I enjoyed music without paying much attention to that. It's music after all, everyone listens to music.  It's only when I began a deep dive into meditation that I started building awareness about how much music really affects my state.
## "**Meditation made me realize that I don't just use music to focus, but also to distract myself from my own thoughts.**"

I was always so confident in the idea that Music helps me feel focused and "energized", but now I'm not so sure about it and I'd encourage everyone to reflect on how they use music and how it makes them feel. The more I meditate and the more I noticed that my best moments of clarity and creativity happened in silence, while feeling truly connected to thoughts, unfiltered and unaltered by external stimulus.


## Balancing Silence and Conscious Stimulation
Nowadays, I still love it, play it... teach it! But I cherish silence more than ever while at the same time learned to appreciate music in new ways. Listening to Music 24/7 up to now, engaging with it very mindfully helped me become more sensitive to it, allowing me to **Play & Create better Music by better appreciating it** 

That's probably why I fell in love with the Ukulele so much, because it doesn't overwhelm that precious silence and one's internal state, it kind of merges with it and supports it.




The end.

# Old version (story comes later):
As someone that loves playing and teaching music so much, it sounds quite ironic to share that I've gradually stopped listening to music in my daily life since the last few years. It wasn't a conscious choice but rather a natural process in understanding how powerful music is on one's mental state and how I started loving it even more by using it... much less.

### Listening to Music is...Impactful
Music is undeniably powerful. It can shift our mood, energize us, or bring us to tears and For years, I enjoyed music without paying much attention to that. It's music after all, everyone listens to music. 

It's not only before I began a deep dive into meditation that I started building awareness about how much music would affect my state. It's Meditation that made me realize that I don't just use music to focus, but also to distract myself from my own thoughts.
### How a 10 day meditation retreat changed my perception of Music
The breakthrough only happened in March 2024 when I attended a 10 day Vipassana retreat, it's a silent meditation with about 10-12 hours of meditation per day where you're not allowed to talk or do anything else than meditating or... meditating. Among the many ways it changed me, I became much **much** more sensitive to Music. I'll always remember when I left the center, feeling in complete ecstasy at the overload of sensations coming from 5km of downhill on my bike. The same night while wild camping in the cold mountains of Switzerland, I started playing some music on my phone, only to stop it a few minutes after because it felt like noise to me. It felt distracting. Even soft, instrumental music, which I previously loved using to focus felt like a distraction. The beats, rhythms, and melodies would pull my mind away from the calm, focused state that I can have without it.

### Clarity and Creativity comes in the Silence
I was always so confident in the idea that Music helps me feel focused and "energized", but now I'm not so sure about it and I'd encourage everyone to reflect on how they use music and how it makes them feel. The more I meditate and the more I noticed that my best moments of clarity and creativity happened in silence. Itâ€™s in this silence that I feel truly connected to my thoughts, unfiltered and unaltered by external influences.


## Balancing Silence and Conscious Stimulation
Nowadays, I still love it, play it, and teach it but I cherish silence more than ever while at the same time started appreciate music in new ways. Listening to Music 24/7 up to now where I intentionally engaging with it very mindfully helped me become more sensitive to it, allowing me to Play & Create better Music. 

That's probably why I fell in love with the Ukulele because it doesn't overwhelm that silence and that internal state, it kind of merges with it and supports it.
