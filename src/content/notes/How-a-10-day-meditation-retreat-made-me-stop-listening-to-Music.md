### The breakthrough happened in March 2024 
I left the Meditation Center, I had just spent 10 days meditating in the Swiss Mountains for about 10-12 hours a day, not allowed to talk nor do anything else than meditating. After saying goodbye to the people I shared the silent experience with, I jumped on the bike to continue my adventure and it started with a "simple 5km downhill" which I'll remember my whole life. I don't know what I expected after 10 days with no stimulation beyond my own thoughts. Going downhill on my little bike fully-loaded turned from routine to complete ecstasy at the overwhelming amount of sensations I experienced. 

*The cold wind on my face, the pressure of my hands holding the handlebar, the feeling of the pedals on my feet and the amazing landscape moving so fast around me all merged into one conscious stream of thoughts.*

### Meditating made me much **much** more sensitive 
After these 10 days, I didn't feel anything the same, everything felt bigger, louder, more intense and beautiful. Eventually, the night came and the day ended in the cold Swiss mountains wild camping: I was feeling. Somehow, I started playing some relaxing music on my phone only to suddenly stop to my own surprise a few minutes later. Why? Because it felt like noise to me, it was distracting me. Even that soft, instrumental music, which I previously loved using to Focus & Write felt like a distraction. The beats, rhythms, and melodies would pull my mind away from the calm, focused state that I was having without it.

For years I had enjoyed listening to music without paying attention to how powerful it can be. Yes, it can shift our mood, energize us, or bring us to tears, but it's music after all, everyone listens to music. It's only when I began a deep dive into meditation that I started building awareness about how much music really affected my state.
## "**Meditation made me realize that I don't just use music to focus, but also to distract myself from my own thoughts.**"

I used to be so confident in the idea that Music helps me feel focused and "energized", but now I'm not so sure about it. The more I meditate and the more I accept that my best moments of clarity and creativity happens in silence when feeling truly connected to my thoughts, unfiltered and unaltered by external stimulus.

Nowadays, I still love it, play it... teach it! But I cherish silence more than ever while at the same time learned to appreciate music in new ways. Listening to Music 24/7 up to now, engaging with it very mindfully helped me become more sensitive to it, not just to the Music I listen to, **but also to the Music I Create.**

That's probably why I fell in love with the Ukulele so much, because it doesn't overwhelm that precious silence and one's internal state, it instead merges with it and supports it.

## Take Aways:
- Meditation/sensory deprivation heightens sensory experiences, making everything feel more vivid and intense.
- Clarity and Creativity is best found in Silence
- Music is sometimes used to focus away from one's own thoughts
- When not feeling alright with silence, that means there's a thought that needs some precious attention and care

The end.
