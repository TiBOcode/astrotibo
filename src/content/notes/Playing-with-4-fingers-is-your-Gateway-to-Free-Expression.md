Ukulele players often vary in their right hand techniques, using anywhere from one to four fingers to play. [Some even opt for a pick](/notes/pick) (but these guys are strange). It's difficult to know where to start, especially without proper guidance or resources.

## The 2 Paths to Ukulele Mastery

| Building on Sand                          | Building on Bedrock                           |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Quicker Start                             | Takes longer to have the foundation           |
| Looks great at first glance               | Requires more effort and patience             |
| Prone to cracks and instability over time | Allows for endless additions and improvements |
| May need complete reconstruction later    | Long term approach to Free Improvisation      |
### In my own journey, I started building on Sand
I experienced myself how bad habits hinders learning. I had limited access to online resources and no teacher. while it certainly helped me develop a unique style, it also slowed down my progress by a lot.

1. **The Two-Finger Phase**: For the first few months, I played with just two fingers. It was comfortable and allowed me to start enjoying music quickly.
2. **The Three-Finger Transition**: I soon realized that some techniques were impossible with just two fingers. Transitioning to three fingers took a few months of practice, it was difficult but felt natural.

3. **My biggest Plateau**: For a full year, I stuck with the three-finger technique, turning it into a habit, not facing the harsh truth that 4 fingers might be a superior way to play this specific playstyle.

4. **The Four-Finger Revelation**: Eventually, I gave the four-finger technique a trial and despite not enjoying it initially, I could sense its potential. I kept playing with a mix of 3 and 4 fingers until there was nothing I could do with 3 fingers that I couldn't do with 4. My Ukulele Improvisation skills then skyrocketed. Not only does it allow the creation of much more complex music, it also makes it so much easier to execute. Each finger having it's own strings allows you to just think about a string, and the associated finger plucks it. 
   Allowing you to focus your precious attention elsewhere to learn even faster.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Starting Right Matters**: Beginning with a proper technique can save time and frustration in the long run. 
2. **Build on Bedrock, not on Sand**: Spend some time learning what Bedrock is. Guidance is what this website's here for and it allows you to take the right decision for yourself before it's too late.
3. **Be Open to Change**: There are no habits that can't be changed. It might be difficult but with Time & Practice, everything's possible.
4. **Persist Through Discomfort**: The initial struggle with any new technique is temporary, the potential for growth is lasting.
