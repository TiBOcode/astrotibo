description: This is the kind of nerdy insights I write about in my personal Daily Notes. I thought I'd start writing them here.

Today I had, while writing, a very deep insight about **how readers process pronouns, particularly "I" and "You"**. It's fresh so I'm mind bending late at night to articulate it better because the implications are many for improving one's writing.

"You" and "I" are words that we use literally everyday, it's the first words you learn when approaching a new language, just writing these first few lines I used "I" 7 times... and yet I just got a brand new perspectives about how to use them.

 
# The conventional definition of "I" and "You"

| **"I"**                                     | **"You"**                                        |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| The speaker/writer referring to themselves. | The person being addressed by the speaker/writer |

So far so good, we've all spent a few years in school but something felt off. This conventional definition, when taken in the context of how the mind **actually processes language** suddenly doesn't make that much intuitive sense anymore.
Studies have shown that when people are processing stories, the same areas of their brain activate as if they were having those experiences themselves. **That's exactly what I experienced on my own writing.** 

â†’**"Writing** **'I' as a writer"** and **"Reading 'I' as a reader"** might be processed similarly by our Brains
# "You" and "I" can be felt the same way 
Let's get practical with a few examples:

"You shouldn't smoke" â†’ While the logical meaning suggests that the reader is being directly addressed, it seems also plausible that the reader might imagine themselves telling someone else "You shouldn't smoke".

"I'm cold"  â†’ Here, the reader might interprets the meaning by unconsciously identifying with the I, in order to extract meaning out of it. It follows the idea of Embodied Cognition. 

"It was difficult, but I went over it" â†’ Here, the reader might subconsciously recall moment in their own lives that has them identify with the sentence. Mentally simulating a tough moment and how they overcame the challenge.


# The Take Away for Better Writing

First-person narratives might be more immersive than previously thought. When a reader encounters "I" in a story, they might end up stepping into the character's shoes in a much more embodied way than I previously imagined.

For a long time, I hated using "I" for the reason that I didn't want to talk about myself. I wanted to talk about *the thing I cared about, not me*. However I'm slowly understanding the power of "I". It invites readers to see through my eyes, feel what I feel, and **relate their own experiences to mine**. In this way, 'I' becomes the most direct path to share knowledge and understanding.
