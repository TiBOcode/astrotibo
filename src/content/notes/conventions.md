title: Breaking Away from Conventions
---

Breaking conventions isn't about rebelling or seeking to be different for its own sake. It’s about responding authentically to what our feelings are telling us. It’s about assessing norms with a realistic perspective—not just on what’s deemed good, but also on what we can truly achieve. The norms says that violon is better than the Ukulele, but would I have realistically more fun in expressing feelings with a Violon that's going to makes everyone's ears bleed for years to come or with a Ukulele that is the underdog (the dog that's under what? English's weird sometimes). 
Ok I looked it up: "Underdog" originates from the world of dogfighting, where it referred to the dog that was expected to lose.
Well in our situation, our Ukulele doesn't have the loudest bark and that's exactly why we love it. It's easy to tame and no one expects it to steal the show.
