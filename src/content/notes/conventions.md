title: Breaking Away from Conventions
---

First of all you play the Ukulele and on top of that you're playing weird?
Let's cover both of these issues with a mild feeling of frustration and playful anger (aka sarcasm).   
# WTF Ukulele?
The norms says that Violon>Ukulele,  but let's be honest, it's realistically more fun in expressing feelings with a Violon that's going to makes everyone's ears bleed for years to come or with a Ukulele that is the underdog (the dog that's under what? English's weird sometimes). 
Ok I looked it up: "Underdog" originates from the world of dogfighting, where it referred to the dog that was expected to lose.
Well in our situation, our Ukulele doesn't have the loudest bark and that's exactly why we love it. It's easy to tame and no one expects it to steal the show. 

So let's ask ourselves a few questions to compare some more accessible instruments 
# The Ultimate Guide to pick your instrument

| **Question**                                                             | Ukulele                                                    | Guitar                                                                                           | Piano                                                                                                      |

| **Can I take it to the beach without looking like I'm trying too hard?** | Absolutely! You'll look chill and approachable             | Maybe, if you're okay with being "that guy"                                                      | You'll need big muscles                                                                                    |
| **How long until I can impress my crush with a song?**                   | A few weeks, and they'll find it adorably charming         | A few months, if you stick to the "10m to Wonderwall Youtube Tutorial"                           | A few years, but you'll impress because of your dedication, not because of the music (which is great too!) |

| **Can I play "Stairway to Heaven"?**                                     | Not really, but do you actually need to?                   | Yes, but please also play something else                                                         | You can, but it might take a stairway to heaven to reach all the keys                                      |
| **Will it help me find inner peace?**                                    | 4 strings of pure Meditation                               | Might be if you train for years:[check this guy's channel!]("https://www.youtube.com/@ecosticks) | Absolutely, nothing says zen like 88 keys staring at you                                                   |
