First of all you play the Ukulele and on top of that you're playing weird?
Let's cover both of these issues with a mild feeling of frustration and playful anger (aka sarcasm).   
# WTF Ukulele?
The norms says that Violon>Ukulele, but it's no Breaking News that a learning journey with the Violon might involve everyone's ears to bleed including yours for years to come. 

The Ukulele is the underdog (the dog that's under what? English's weird sometimes). 
Ok I looked it up: "Underdog" originates from the world of dogfighting, where it referred to the dog that was expected to lose.
Well in our situation, our Ukulele doesn't have the loudest bark and that's exactly why we love it. It's easy to tame and no one expects it to steal the show. 

More realistically, if you want to start learning an instrument, you might end up picking between the Piano, the Guitar or the Ukulele
