# Choose your path wisely

Think of this as **a Guide to Unlocking Your Creative Potential.** "Creativity" isn't a magical gift, it's a skill that can be Learned & Practiced. The Ukulele is the perfect gateway to step into this world of Self Expression and Self Discovery; but don't worry, you're not alone and you don't have to create everything from scratch. Great musicians take what's already there and use their own unique path to combine this existing knowledge, chords and rhythms in a way that feels Unique to Yourself.

 ## Simply follow the path that resonates with your own voice.

Through these notes, you'll learn about a unique way of playing revolving around Simplicity and Free Expression, breaking away from the widespread idea that learning music has to be an infinite grind until you eventually become one with the instrument. Not only can you Succeed in your Musical Journey but this approach is intentionally crafted to ensure your experience is both rewarding and fun.
