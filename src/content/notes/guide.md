# Start Exploring

### Knowledge (Early Access)
This is the Tips factory where everything will branch out from. It's the open door to my ideas about developing one's skills with Music, note by note. will serve as a checkpoint for all the advanced concepts I want to share about music & life. <br>

### Techniques (Coming Soon)
This is a listing of Ukulele Techniques I'll detail. These are more tangible elements of Ukulele playing that I'm also going to use in my videos once I'll have a solid library.<br>
[→ 📝Ukulele Techniques](/notes/UkuleleTechniques)

### The Method (Coming Soon)
Here I'll design a more structured learning path for both beginner and more advanced players to 📝[Develop their skills](/notes/foundation)

### The Ukulele Roadmap (Coming Soon)
I'm thinking of creating a📝[RoadMap](/notes/roadmap) to help people overview of what it takes to learn Ukulele Improvisation. For now it's just an idea, I'm working on it!

# Other Ideas

*Only when it decides to play, sometimes reloading the page fixes the issue*
