## Choose your path wisely

Welcome to a place where the key techniques and practical tips to start or transform the relation you have with Music.
Great musicians take what‚Äôs already there and weave it into something unique. But to do that effectively, you need to know the basics. And the first rule? Sometimes, less is more‚Äîlet your ukulele‚Äôs simplicity shine.

Think of this as **a guide to creativity because creativity isn‚Äôt a single moment, but a process**. Being creative with your ukulele doesn‚Äôt mean you have to be the first to discover a new sound; it‚Äôs about connecting existing chords and rhythms in a way that feels fresh. You don‚Äôt need to start from scratch. 

Through these notes, you'll learn about a different playstyle revolving around simplicity and free expression to break away from the widespread idea that learning music is an infinite grind until you eventually become one with the instrument. While there are some truth to that, these are mostly limiting beliefs that prevent you from finding your own voice. Not only can you learn how to improvise thanks to the fact that but you can do it while having fun and this method is designed to teach you exactly that
