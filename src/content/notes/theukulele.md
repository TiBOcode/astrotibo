title: The Ukulele is the one of the best instrument to Improvise on
---
The Ukulele gained a lot in popularity since the last years and there are many reasons for that, some are Obvious, some are not. 
# Limited Range, Small Size, Simplicity

1. **It's an atmosphere enhancer** 
The Ukulele doesn't **dominate**, it **elevates**. the limited range and high pitch tones makes it very easy to listen to compared to instruments such as the guitar or the piano. Understanding the difference is crucial to understand Ukulele's main purpose in making the present moment bright and playful.

2. **It's small, convenient and rock solid (or wood solid)**
Something extremely important for any music instrument is how easy it is to pick up and play. I carried mine everywhere on a bike for a few years and it never failed me. I left it to kids to play with without a care in the world and it always came back with 4 strings (and a few more irrelevant scratches which makes it more unique). 

3. **It's underrated**
Even though it's changing quite a lot since the last few years, many people still see the Ukulele as "a little guitar". As Ukulele players we should learn to appreciate that, the Ukulele is a humble instrument that **frees players from the weight of musical perfectionism, competitive pressure** for us to focus on a more authentic and free expression. 
People listening don't have much expectations, it makes it very easy to surprise ourselves and others with how much one can do with such a free instrument. 
*Sidenote: Especially as a man, playing a music instrument such as the guitar can sometimes turn into "who's got the biggest?". It's hard enough to be vulnerable, the Ukulele makes it slightly easier

# A 4 Strings powerhouse for Creative Expression

1. **Simplicity** 
I could write an entire book about how important simplicity and accessibility are, whether we're talking about music or life in general. It's not easy task to explain why [Most people should learn the Ukulele instead of the Guitar](ukulelevsguitar). The relation between Simplicity and Creative Freedom

2. **Infinite possibilities**
Simple doesn't mean Limited, this entire website is built on deconstructing that myth in Music but also Life in general. 
Throughout this website you'll find resources to learn about the many ways to take the most out of this so called simplicity. 

3. **Mindfulness Tool**
Finally, this is where it shines. This is what I'm using it for almost daily and where you might want to give it a second look. Music isn't just about having fun, it's mostly about Self Expression & Introspection. It's a mean of communication that needs to be taken very seriously. 
Ukulele's simplicity allows for creative improvisation. Creative Expression allows for deep connections with one's self. Being able to resonate with your own music in very simple ways is a gateway to understanding yourself better and managing your own emotional state.

Note: I'll write more on that with time.
