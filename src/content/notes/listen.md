```
An experienced chef tastes layers of flavor you don't 
An experienced driver feels its car in ways you don't
An experienced painter sees subtle color variations you don't  
An experienced masseur senses muscle tension you don't 
An experienced musician hears music in ways you don't
```

Experts do things differently because they learned to feel things differently, they experience the world in ways novices can't imagine. This isn't to tell you that you currently suck, but just to appreciate what learning actually means.

# Learning is Embodied in your Senses

Here's the posit; "You're currently not hearing your Music the way it sounds". And before you start feeling overwhelmed by questions, let me explain better. Our hears, much like our other senses, are great at recognizing sounds we heard before. The way we hear is shaped by our [experiential development](https://github.com/TiBOcode/astrotibo/blob/main/notes/experientialdevelopment), everything we sense is shaped & influenced by it too and if you want to become good at anything, you'll have to spend time fine tuning your senses, whether it's done unconsciously or consciously.

The craziest part is that we're blind to it until we start developing these senses through accumulated practice. It takes weeks and months to develop these senses and learning comes along the way.

# Practice Transforms Perception

And you can learn how to develop those skills by Engaging the Senses as early as possible. This is also how you should measure progress. Not by just "How beautiful is that thing you play" but rather "How much do you feel while playing".

Can you feel the subtle touch of your fingers as you pluck the strings? Can you feel your pinky stretching from one string to the next? Can you feel the strings vibrate as you hear the sound they produce? Can you feel how the sound makes you feel like while at the same time imagine what's coming next?

# The more you spend time hearing the sound, the better you'll become

This is the kind of title that makes half of the people think "Of course that's so obvious!" and the other half "Wtf is that and why should I care?"

During my time adventuring the world by bike is when I also picked up Music, at that time when I first started, [üìùmy musical skills were terrible](/üìùmy musical skills were terrible)

# Practical implications

- The same way you do a body scan, you want to regularly bring your attention to all your senses
- Targeting genuine blind spots while avoiding illusory competence
- [üìù**Learn More about your senses by Studying them**]
