Draw a House is a side project that I undergo for fun and self discovery only. It's a way for me to express myself on things I need to express and don't want to forget. It's my self therapy, expressing publicly what motivated the decisions that made my life different and the vulnerability behind the process of change. 

I don't take it too seriously, I don't care about the views nor how much it resonates, I do it for myself for fun. Although "fun" might not be the right word, because making these videos, especially writing the script has been very intense for me. I had more than a few times let tears come out of me as I realize (or accept) important things about my own narrative.
