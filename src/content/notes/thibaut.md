title: My full name is Thibaut Gabriel.

The French language has a deep passion for **silent letters**. Somehow Thibaut=Tibo... **it is pronounced the exact same way**. 
Why making it simple when you can make it complicated? 

## Story Time
When my mom was choosing my name, the name was most commonly spelled "Thibau**l**t" with an extra 'L' but still pronouced the exact same "Tibo". She thought it was overly complicated and therefore decided that removing the silent 'l' would make sense. Completely missing out on the many other silent letters 'H', 'T' and the absurd 'AU'='O'.

**Thibault=Thibaut=Tibo**

It seems that everyone speaking French natively has an advanced form of Inattentional Blindness related to these silent letters.
