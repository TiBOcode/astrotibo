title: Thibaut

My full name is Thibaut Gabriel.

The French language has a deep passion for **silent letters**. Somehow Thibaut=Tibo... **it is pronounced the exact same way**. 
Why making it simple when you can make it complicated? 

Story Time: When my mom was choosing my name, she found that the most common way this name is written is "Thibau**l**t"(spoiler: it's pronounced "Tibo" the same) and thought it was overly complicated . She therefore decided that removing the silent 'l' would make sense. Completely missing out on the many other silent letters 'h', 't' and the absurd 'au=o'. 

It seems that everyone speaking French natively has an advanced form of Inattentional Blindness related to these silent letters.
