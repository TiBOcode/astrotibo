This sounds like a fine joke. A joke to which one wants to answer: "Ok great, then I won't play at all!"

IT all depends on why you play music, I love playing loud and funky, but what I love the most is reaching a state of Flow where I don't even hear the music I play

I'll cover what is flow in the context of Music

Let me explain, there are 2 categories of music. 
- The kind of music that grab your attention and bring you somewhere specific. 
- Foreground music, Attention-grabbing, directional.
- The kind of music that support your mood@ and that you tend to forget. Background music?

Ukulele's high pitch is easily forgotten

Most of the times, when you notice the music, it means there was something that changed,  surprise is the driver for attention,
