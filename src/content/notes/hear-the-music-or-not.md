This sounds like a fine joke. A joke to which one wants to answer: "Ok great, then I won't play at all!"

Yet, this is an important idea. Playing loud and funky is fun but the best moments in music are the ones where you reach a state of Flow, and surprisingly, it involves periods where the music goes in the background. 



I'll cover what is flow in the context of Music

Let me explain, there are 2 categories of music. 
- The kind of music that grab your attention and bring you somewhere specific. 
- Foreground music, Attention-grabbing, directional.
- The kind of music that support your mood@ and that you tend to forget. Background music?

Ukulele's high pitch is easily forgotten

Most of the times, when you notice the music, it means there was something that changed, surprise is the driver for attention,
