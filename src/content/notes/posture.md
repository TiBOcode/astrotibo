description: This note was initially centered around the importance of posture but it seems to connect to the importance of relaxing the body/mind. There’s an overarching theme to be found here.

Paying attention to one's posture is an advice I heard from many talented musicians and it never really resonated in me before a long while, I now consider it one of the most underrated aspect of playing music.


## Here’s the simplified reason why:

**Improvement in Music is about incremental tuning of fine motor control skills.** 
Improving fine motor control in music is about making your movements more efficient and precise over time. Initially, when you touch your instrument for the first time, your movements are be exaggerated and there’s a lot of tension in your hands, arms (and body as a whole!) because you're still figuring out how to produce the correct notes and rhythms. As you practice, you naturally start to identify unnecessary tension or effort in your playing but this process takes a long time. 

The process of refining these skills means greatly reducing that tension while maintaining the same level of accuracy and expression. It's about smaller, more controlled movements to achieve the same desired result. The goal is to reach a point where your playing feels effortless, even while immersed in a complex improvisation.

Lazy Play


Most of the physical part of Learning Music is about relaxing muscles, releasing tension, creating the same result with half the effort. 

You want to be as relaxed as possible. A huge part of the physical skills is acquired by working on relaxing the muscle.
A person's learning journey when they first start is about learning which muscle to use in order to produce the desired sound. Then the rest is about learning about which muscle to not use while keeping the same result. 

 
External Posture Work Internal Body Awareness
Attempting to match an ideal form
Exploring what feels comfortable and effective
Correcting based on visual feedback
Adjusting based on physical sensations and sound quality
Rigid adherence to "proper" technique
Flexible adaptation to your body's needs

Goal: Looking correct
Goal: Feeling good and playing well


# Perfecting your Body Posture: Listen to your Body

# “It's not about how good you look, it's about how good you feel”
*(It’s funny how some of these sentences also apply to all aspects of life)*


### The Posture Roadmap
If you're a beginner, try and get into a simple posture that works out for you, don't bother too much with it now, you might want to close your eyes and body scan while holding/playing the instrument at some point, but you want to first be able to be comfortable playing before developing a powerful body posture

After a few months is when it becomes interesting, by that time you should have developed a postural habit and that's when you want to break it down
You now should be able to enter a flow while playing a simple loop. Play slow, then start the body scan and relax. Feel -> Relax, Feel -> Relax.  Try different postures, 

# Play lazy

The difficult part is feeling "everything together", when you're a beginner you can't expect to add complexity to to the overwhelming amount of novel sensations you already feel when playing music.
