Paying attention to one's posture is an advice I heard from many talented musicians and it never really resonated in me before a long while, I now consider, a key element of any practice. 

Let's explain:


# It's not about how good you look, it's about how good you feel

Posture = Body 
**Perspective**: Posture work is often about how you look, while body feelings are about how you feel.
You want to spend time feeling your body to get into 

You want to be as relaxed as possible. A huge part of the physical skills is acquired by working on relaxing the muscle.
A person's learning journey when they first start is about learning which muscle to use in order to produce the desired sound. Then the rest is about learning about which muscle to not use while keeping the same result. 

Improvement in music making is extremely correlated with muscle tension. The less tension you have, the better your fine motor control skills.

My approach to Ukulele being on that engages the sense, you really want to spend time learning that 

External Posture WorkInternal Body AwarenessAttempting to match an ideal formExploring what feels comfortable and effectiveCorrecting based on visual feedbackAdjusting based on physical sensations and sound qualityRigid adherence to "proper" techniqueFlexible adaptation to your body's needsGoal: Looking correctGoal: Feeling good and playing well


# Perfecting your Body Posture: Listen to your Body

Here's the summarized set of advices: If you're a beginner, try and get into a simple posture that works out for you, don't bother too much with it now, you might want to close your eyes and body scan while holding/playing the instrument, but you want to first be able to be comfortable playing before perfecting your final body posture

After a few months is when it becomes interesting, by that time you should have developed a postural habit and that's when you want to break it down
You now should be able to enter a flow while playing a simple loop. Play slow, then start the body scan and relax. Feel -> Relax, Feel -> Relax.  Try different postures, 

# Play lazy

The difficult part is feeling "everything together", when you're a beginner you can't expect to add complexity to to the overwhelming amount of novel sensations you already feel when playing music.
