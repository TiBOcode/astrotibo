Scales are mathematically equivalent to one another, meaning that you can play the same exact thing from one scale to another. But yet they feel extremely different to one another.  So what really creates variety in sound and feeling?
**=> it isn't the scale itself, it’s how we play it on the instrument.**

The tuning and positions on a fretboard create limitations that make each scale feel distinct, even though the structure remains the same. The real difficulty isn’t just memorizing notes, though that’s part of it, but breaking out of ingrained patterns and adjusting how the scale feels under your fingers. It’s as much about mindset as it is about technique.

## Shifting from Habit to Awareness

Our habits play a big role when learning a scale. We tend to rely on familiar fingerings or positions, which lock us into patterns that can make new scales feel foreign or wrong. We might be playing all the right notes but fail to connect to the sound we create because of how foreign it sounds to us. However, once you start exploring beyond your habitual playing, you begin to hear the subtle mood of each scale.

It’s important to approach scales like learning the feel of a completely new sound landscape, rather than just memorizing a map of notes. This can be done by slowing down and connecting with a few notes at a time. Start small—choose just two notes of a scale and really hear them, feel them, and explore how they relate. Then, slowly add more, expanding your connection with the scale gradually, step by step.

## Practical Guidance and Deduction from Experience

*Note: this is a personal reflection on teaching people abstract concept such as this one.* 
Learning a concept like scales isn’t just theoretical, it’s experiential. That’s why every time I dive into a topic like this, I want to include a **guided experience** that lets people feel the idea themselves. This way, it’s not just about hearing an explanation, but about letting you deduce the meaning from your own playing and exploration.

The concept I’m talking about here: « feeling the difference in scales » can be translated into an exercise where I guide you through playing just a couple of notes of a new scale at a time, exploring how that sounds, and reflecting on how it feels. From there, you build your understanding organically, discovering the essence of the scale without needing to memorize everything up front.

And even better, this practical guidance helps you get familiar with the scale very fast as it involves a pleasure first approach into the practice.
