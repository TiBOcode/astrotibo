title: Why I might hinder my channel with this blog

I wanted to raise an issue about this blog.

The main reason why I started this blog is to significantly improve the value I bring to people. This is part of the mission behind this unique project. It's to support people in their own personal journeys by sharing knowledge on how to use Ukulele Improvisation as a tool for Self Discovery and Creativity.

Now... this project's main platform remains Youtube and if you are reading these words, chances are that you found me through Youtube, which is the platform many creators, including I, are entirely dependent on. Turns out also that one of Youtube's algorithm goal is to keep people watching videos, it is to keep people on its platform to binge until chicken grow teeth (that's a french expression, it does looks fairly stupid in english). What my Website is doing is redirecting you here instead of having you binge more videos, essentially reducing the time you spend on the platform and it likely has/will have a big impact on the growth of my channel.

I thought about it, a friend of mine raised the same concern without me asking him. But in the end I decided that I didn't have to care. That I didn't have to care because the value this website can provide is bigger than that risk, and that the risk itself is not something I nor others should really care about. I trust people to find their way to content they like, whether it's mine or not, the rest is just external factors that are outside my locus of control. (Fancy way of saying, "can't do anything about it therefore I don't care")
