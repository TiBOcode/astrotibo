This raises the question, "**Why** do you play Music"? and unless you're a parent pleasing prodigy practicing scales for 8 hours a day to win competitions no one cares about, you might want to take some time to answer that question for yourself.

The "Why do you play Music" is different for everyone, it might also change for yourself overtime and that's fine. But just like any kind of Art, when pleasure is in the driver seat is when the player shines.

# Let's zoom in through the lens of External vs Internal Pleasure

**External Pleasure:** This is the kind of satisfaction that comes from social validation like: applause, praise, social media, or competitions. It's loose and dependent on others' opinions. I'm not trying to say that learning music to impress a crush is a bad idea, but just that it should come as a secondary motivator, otherwise you'll end up with a dusty Ukulele and a broken heart. 

**Internal Pleasure:** This is where the act of playing is relying on Self centered joy. It's about how the music makes you feel, regardless of what anyone else thinks. This pleasure is lasting and entirely within your control because you're the one doing the applause and praise on yourself when you notice that your right hand fingerpicking is now 2% more precise than it was the day before. 

Remember when you play that, you're not playing for an imaginary audience or for social media. Most of the time you're playing for an audience of one: **Yourself**. And definitely, that's the best audience you'll ever have.


There is some degree of Personal Fulfillment attached to finally being able to play music, a desire to express yourself creatively, to have fun with something truly unique
