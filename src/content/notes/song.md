First, because other people do it way better than I do. 
Second, because I've always felt like there was something more to Music.

# The issue with songs
Songs are like reproduction of some else's creation, much like walking in someone's footsteps. Sure at first you're learning new stuff, feeling accomplished. But here's the deal: once you learn a song, you're mostly just stuck following it. Play it the same way, every time. And before you know it, bam! You hit a plateau

Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against playing songs, whether it is singing or fingerstyle. Nothing beats the nostalgic aspect of playing a song you grew up with, nor the social aspect of connecting with your friends and family by sharing something that everyone knows. 

# My Real Passion
It's just that I'm passionate about using and teaching [Music as a tool for Introspection and Self Expression](/notes/freeexpression). Not only is it rewarding in a very unique way, but it's also much easier and accessible than people think!
