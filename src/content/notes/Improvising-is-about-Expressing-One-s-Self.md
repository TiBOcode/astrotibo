Improvising is amazing, witnessing the music unfold in front of one's eyes (or hears) is mind blowing and being the one improvising is a story on its own. 

Learning how to improvise music is extremely rewarding, but it's a very peculiar skill to learn, because words are tricky and misleading sometimes. Improvising is about Expressing One's Self, which means that Learning to improvise means Learning how to Express One's Self. 

This is extremely important.
