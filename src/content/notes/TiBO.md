[My name is Thibaut Gabriel](thibaut) but you can call me Tibo, I'm a 28years old French guy who's trying to build a life for himself. Like everyone, I guess. 

## My life took a big turn of events
About 4/5 years ago, I left a promising career to start a cross country journey by bike which never really ended. The impact it had on my life is immense. Among many things I picked upon the road, there was the Ukulele.


## Who am I?
When talking about one's self, I like to talk about values. A value is the compass that guide one's actions after all, much like a North Star.
