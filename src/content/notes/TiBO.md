[My name is Thibaut Gabriel](/notes/thibaut) but you can call me Tibo, I'm a 28years old French guy who's trying to build a life for himself. Like everyone, I guess. 

## My life took a big turn of events
About 4/5 years ago, I left a promising career to start a cross country journey by bike which never really ended. The impact it had on my life is immense. Among many things I picked upon the road, there was the Ukulele.



## Who am I?
When talking about one's self, I like to talk about values. A value is the compass that guide one's actions after all, much like a North Star. 

##### My Values:
- Money and Fame: [Value First Approach](/notes/valuevfa) 
- Ego and Identity [Self Less Service](/notes/value-self-less-service)
- Relation to others: 📝[Authenticity & Vulnerability](/notes/authenticity)
