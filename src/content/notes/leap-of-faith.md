# Definition and Core Concept

A Leap of Faith is the act of taking a difficult decision despite uncertainty about the outcome, relying on trust and other factors to bridge the knowledge gap. Understanding the Leap of Faith involves accepting uncertainty as a natural aspect of decision-making.

In many instances, taking the Leap is the only way to acquire that precious information which would allow us to take the right decision in the first place.

# It's normal to feel Stuck

Most important decisions are always taken with high uncertainty. Most of us try hard to reduce that uncertainty gap by seeking more information, by evaluating options and calculating risks. 

### Decision-Making is difficult

To understand one's own decision in everyday life:
- "How can I know if know if this thing I'm practicing is going to be useful to me in the long run?"
- "How can I know if I'm going to benefit from subscribing to that channel or newsletter?"
- "How can I know if this product/service is going to fulfill its promise?"

To support other people's decisions:
- "How can I reduce that knowledge gap for people so that they can take better decisions for themselves?"

# What the Leap of Faith means for my content 

As I develop my [Value First Approach](/notes/valuevfa), I'm working on giving clear information to people in order to help them get actual value from the proposed services. It involves:
- Being more honest, direct and concise
- Accepting a lower conversion rate
- Ensuring that people making decisions do so with more clarity
- Increasing the likelihood that people will fully benefit from their decisions to follow the content

- Some people take many bold decisions, seemingly careless of potential risks (Low vs High Uncertainty Avoidance (Hofstede's Cultural Dimension)
- Others are stuck in Analysis Paralysis, unable to move forward because of the fear associated with the Leap of Faith
- People generally have Loss Aversion. While this allows us to take relatively good decisions on a daily basis, it also hinders our potential for exploration and discovery.
