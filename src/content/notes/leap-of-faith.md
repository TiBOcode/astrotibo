## Definition and Core Concept

A Leap of Faith is the act of taking a difficult decision despite uncertainty about the outcome, relying on trust and other factors to bridge the knowledge gap. Understanding the Leap of Faith involves accepting uncertainty as a natural aspect of decision-making.

In many instances, taking the Leap is the only way to acquire that precious information which would allow us to take the right decision in the first place.

## The Role of Uncertainty in Decision-Making

Most important decisions are always taken with high uncertainty. Most of us try hard to reduce that uncertainty gap by seeking more information, by evaluating options and calculating risks. 

### Common Questions in Decision-Making

To understand one's own decision:
- "How can I know if joining this program is going to be useful for me in the long run?"
- "How can I know if I'm going to benefit from subscribing to that channel or newsletter?"
- "How can I know if this product/service is going to fulfill its promise?"

To support other people's decisions:
- "How can I reduce that knowledge gap for people so that they can take better decisions for themselves?"

- Others are stuck in Analysis Paralysis, unable to move forward because of the fear associated with the Leap of Faith
- People generally have Loss Aversion. While this allows us to take relatively good decisions on a daily basis, it also hinders our potential for exploration and discovery.
