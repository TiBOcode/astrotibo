While traditional approaches are often centered around reductionist traps around the influence of genetic, culture, experiences etc...**"Experiential Development" is a term which gained popularity in the evergreen Nurture vs Culture debate**. It's a more relaxed approach acknowledging how multi faceted human development is. 


Your Developmental Experience is everything that makes you who you are. It takes into account your genetic, but your education as well. All the little event that added up, influencing your curiosity, your interests, shaping the way you interact with the world and how you perceive it. 

It's also addressing the idea that your identity has been evolving throughout your life and will likely continue to do so. It's the idea that you changed, and that you will continue to grow and change.
