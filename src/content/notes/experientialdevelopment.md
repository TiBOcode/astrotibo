"Imagine for a moment, the countless influences that have shaped who you are now, from the first book you read as a child to a random conversation with a stranger. This is what Experiential Development seeks to explore." It's a term which gained popularity in **the evergreen Nurture vs Culture debate**. It's a more relaxed approach acknowledging how multi faceted human development is. 

All the little event that added up, influencing your curiosity, your interests, shaping the way you interact with the world and how you perceive it.
