As you create music, moments of silence are as important as the notes of the music themselves. Back in November 2021 when I decided to "turn back and head home", I was in Armenia with my bicycle. Long story short I passed Istanbul on my way and met a very talented pianist. Apart from making me understand how bad my music skills were at the time, she taught me some invaluable lessons. One of them was held in a frame standing above her piano and read the fantastic:
# "Sessizliƒüi bazen de dinle"
In English, it translates as: "Sometimes, also listen to the silence". More literally, silence here is meant as "the silenceness"... the Turkish sentence stayed with me for a long while, I even drew it on the back of my old crappy Ukulele.

Silence as a concept is quite amazing, it turns something that doesn't exist into "something". It's like "0", or "nothing". Without the word, it is impossible to point at it you can only define it by what it's not: nothing is the absence of something, silence is the absence of sound.  

- In Japanese, there's a concept called "ma", referring to the "space" or "emptiness between things". 
- In some meditation practices, you are asked to "pay attention to the silence between thoughts"
The list is long and I'm a bit of a fanatic when it comes to these things. Let's bring it back to Music. 

# How to Listen to the Silence
Now prepare yourself for some mind bending ideas:

Listening here can be translated as "feeling", the only way you really process music is by feeling it. By sensing what it makes you feel like and why. The more you feel, the more you reflect on those feelings, the more you'll be able to hear & imagine. **Listening to the silence is one very powerful mindful practice** to become better at that, this is one of many counterintuitive things that make one's musical skills so hard to develop without a mentor. In my case, I had this friend to teach me that. 

So create music and not only do you want to listen to the silence, you want to "play it", think about silence as a tool in your arsenal, something you can "use". Listen to it and overdo it until you find the proper balance. Remember that the effect of a silence can be created in 3 different way:

- The Passive way: By not plucking the strings and letting the sound fade out
- The Active way: By muting the strings, actively stopping the sound
- The Skilled way: By mastering Dynamics to create volume variations that feel like Silence
