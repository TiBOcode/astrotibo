Back in 2021 when I decided to "turn back and head home", I was in Armenia with my bicycle. Long story short I passed Istanbul on my way and met a very talented pianist. Apart from making me understand how bad my music skills were at the time, she taught me some invaluable lessons. One of them was held in a frame standing above her piano and read the fantastic:
# "SessizliÄŸi bazen de dinle"
In english, it would translate as: "Sometimes, also listen to the silence". More literally, silence here is meant as "the silenceness"... the Turkish sentence stayed with me for a long while, I had it written on my old crappy Ukulele

Silence as a concept is quite amazing, it turns something that doesn't exist into "something". It's like "0", or "nothing". Without the word, it is impossible to point at it and yet, the only way to describe it is by abstract comparison or by defining it by what it's not: nothing is the absence of something, silence is the absence of sound. 

- In Japanese, there's a concept called "ma", referring to the "space" or "emptiness between things". 
- In some meditation practices, you are asked to "pay attention to the silence between thoughts"
The list is long and I'm a bit of a fanatic when it comes to these things. Let's bring it back to Music. 

# The takeaway
As you create music, listening@ to the silence is as important as listening to the music itself. Here, listening means "feeling"
