Let’s start with a few questions: 
- What is Music Theory?
- Limits of MT: Tells you what should sound good, but doesn’t tell you why it makes you feel the way it does

- Why do one need to learn MT
- What is my personal experience with MT (process + takeaways)
- What is the expected & traditional approach to MT 
- How do I use MT in my Play?
- MT as a set of tools
- Different play styles different tools
- Ukulele StoryTelling MT specific vs Traditional Ukulele MT
- Traditional/Theoretical MT vs Practical MT

So why MT? MT is like that imaginary scary monster you’re afraid of when you’re a kid, except that it’s real and actually scary.

Unfortunately there’s no way around it. I’ve struggled with it, everyone’s struggling with it. You go on youtube and type ”Learn Music Theory in only 10minutes” and you’ll find 500 people claiming that they solved it for you. Fortunately time passed and we’re now far from the old times where Music theory was rigid like a stone wall. While it still exist in the conservatory and in music schools, there’s now many ways around it. And by “around”, I don’t mean skipping it, I mean learning what you’re actually going to use and actually have fun with it, because yes it’s possible.



Learning Music is made of many abstract concepts, it’s difficult because there’s not much tangible to help you “master” it. Music Theory is a trial at doing that. It emerged from a desire to explain, to rationalize, to structure and to teach. It’s built upon this natural connection humans have with music since the beginning of humanity and it now turned into a science, where you can make mathematical recipes to obtain music. It’s also a tool to communicate music to each other but also to oneself.


So how would teaching be done? I like things that are visual, but also practical. Let’s start with a long explanation that will lead to instant result, starting from the 12 notes. 

We have A A# B C C# D D# E F F# G G#
Ideally in a table or even better, a circle.
Animation will be king here. I have to play around with visuals

From the 12 notes we can have 12 Scales = or 12 Keys

What we want is to find our major scale, that’s the most basic of all standard. So standard that saying “scale” means “major scale”. That’s our friend, let’s remember it.

Each scale uses 7 of the 12 notes. 
There are 12 notes, therefore there are 12 scales
The C scale is the standard scale, it’s not just a friend, it’s our best friend
. Let’s get to know them.
Take any note and you can have a scale out of that note by . 
A B C# D E F# G# A





Words that are tough on the beginner’s mind:
Note
Scale
Key
