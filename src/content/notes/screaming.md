title: Screaming is Raw Authenticity 
---

How important is it to express yourself authentically?  How important is it to let go and express those overwhelming feeling, even if it's done through the most primitive way you can? 

# Express yourself 
That's what I felt the need to and experienced during my years traveling. Wild camping in mountains, deserts, forests...alone with my thoughts without a way to distract myself away from what needs care and attention. Screaming is Catharsis through Sound and I embraced that. 

### Embracing Taboo
Screaming isn't something I do routinely but I've done it many times and still do fairly often. I believe many do too, hiding from others, screaming in the car, in the shower... many people do it on other people to solve their own internal issues... It is such a taboo behavior but how much it helps you feel better is beyond words. 
*(You'd want to do it **with** others and not **onto** others)* 

### How I do that?
I would sometimes start whispering and raise the volume progressively, I might dance and act at the same time. Sometimes I'd express things that feel like sadness, sometimes anger. In any case it never really feel good on the moment but following the trail of intense feelings is how I believe emotions are released. 

**You feel it, you follow it, you express it**
