Before even picking up Music, I was already very attracted to the idea of blindfolding oneself. My movement meditation routine is done blindfolded and it became the only reliable way for me to connect with any meditation based practice.

Playing Music blindfolded is difficult because you intentionally give up on an essential sense that you rely on to play music. For the right hand, it makes it more difficult to know where are each strings in relation to your fingers, for the left hand, it turns every chord change into a challenging game of blind guesses‚Ä¶ essentially it makes your music full of ~~mistakes~~ surprises! And last but not least, for your mind, it‚Äôs difficult, frustrating, limiting. But there must be at least a few reasons for why it is such a powerful practice that I personally cherish so much. Being able to play without needing a pair of eyes is not a goal in itself but the outcome of a deep connection with the instrument. Most renowned musicians have developed the ability to play without relying on sight and it‚Äôs a critical skill to develop. 

Now, most of these musicians began developing this connection with their instrument at a young age but turns out it‚Äôs never too late. Sensory Deprivation with a Blindfolded practice is an amazing place to start!

### Enhanced Focus on Hearing and Touch
A blindfold practice is essentially about Sensory Deprivation. As humans, we are highly reliant on vision (there aren‚Äôt so many animals with the sharp eyes we have), while it serves us very well, it tends to overshadow our other senses. When it comes to music, vision is useful at first but it has its drawbacks. **It‚Äôs slow, imperfect and limited**. You can only observe one part at a time and in the end and you end up ‚Äúplaying with your eyes‚Äù which is fine if you‚Äôre a beginner, but as you become more serious about learning it‚Äôs crucial to shift this reliance to the senses that truly matter: Hearing and Touch, which are far more precise and reactive. When we think about it‚Ä¶ vision involves particles of light bouncing off the instrument, entering the eyes (only if you look in the right direction), being processed by the brain which then reacts to it by moving the muscles‚Ä¶ Ok ok that‚Äôs ridiculous.

Blindfolding yourself if a straightforward approach to enhancing your focus on hearing and touch.  

### Entry door to Visualization & Mental Imagery
Who said you can‚Äôt see with your eyes closed? Well, turns out you can. Our minds have the amazing ability to create mental representation that allow us to navigate the world, I‚Äôm a huge mental imagery nerd and I learned much of it thanks to this unique blindfolded practice. Give it some practice and you‚Äôll notice that even though you can‚Äôt ‚Äùsee‚Äù the fretboard, you can still imagine it, very abstractly at first until the mental image starts becoming clearer and clearer. This works wonder for fretboard visualization which you couple with the left hand and also with the 4 Strings 4 Fingers approach.  

Enhanced Attention 
Last but not least, a simple reason why I love blindfolding so much is because it remove visual distractions. Your eyes stop wandering around scanning the environment for random stuff to observe. You can ground yourself in your practice much more easily and this is what I look into the most. Beyond the pure learning aspect, there‚Äôs a genuine desire to enjoy creating music. To connect to the activity in a meaningful way, blindfolding has been a reliable way for me to get into this space. Turning the simple act of playing music even more immersive and magical.
