An experienced chef tastes layers of flavor you don't 
An experienced driver feels its car in ways you don't
An experienced painter sees subtle color variations you don't  
An experienced masseur senses muscle tension you don't 
An experienced musician hears music in ways you don't
```

Experts do things differently because they learned to feel things differently, they experience the world in ways novices can't imagine. This gives us a more tangible roadmap to get better. Let’s just appreciate what learning actually means.

## Mastering Ukulele is about Training your Senses

Mastering the Ukulele is more than just learning chords and strumming patterns, it’s about fully engaging with the instrument in a way that integrates all your senses. And you can learn how to develop those skills by Engaging the Senses as early as possible. This is also how you should measure your own progress. 

Progress is measured by "How much more do I feel while playing?" Instead of "How beautiful is that thing I’m playing?"

Can you feel the subtle touch of your fingers as you pluck the strings? Can you feel your pinky stretching from one string to the next? Can you feel the strings vibrate as you hear the sound they produce? Can you feel how the sound makes you feel like while at the same time imagine what's coming next?

## Mastery vs Capability
The difference between Capability and Mastery is subtle and yet profound. Capability is being able to play a Em chord. Mastery is being able to play that Em chord with such ease that you can effortlessly hold it, feel it and imagine potential path to continue the story. Mastery of the Basics means you’re not just competent, you’re so comfortable that you can innovate and experiment on the go, building layers of complexity upon a rock-solid foundation.





Here's the posit, becoming great at music involves focused practice to fine tune these senses, with practice, you’ll be able to realize that:
You will hear the music you play differently 
You will feel music with more granularity
You will sense the softness of the strings on each of your fingers with more clarity
You will feel your body posture at the same you play
📝….. I’ll list all the practices here with links to the notes




# Practical implications
