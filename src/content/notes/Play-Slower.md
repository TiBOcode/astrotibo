Embracing Slow Play is about more than just improving your ukulele skills. It's about developing patience, attention to detail, and the confidence to face imperfections. It's a mindset that can transform not just your music, but your approach to learning and growth in all areas of life.

1. The Order :”PLAY SLOWER!”
2. The Explanation: More complex than you think

Slowing down music is like driving a car downhill, you need to hit the brakes to maintain control and avoid crashing into the next obstacle. It’s not just about preventing mistakes, slowing down builds the precision and confidence needed to eventually play with skill at any speed. In the context of music it about moving that right hand slower with more care and attention. It requires much more mental juggling than it seems like, which is what leads us to break this first myth about 

~~Faster = Harder~~.
# Slower = Harder

## Speed creates an illusion of skills. 
When things are getting complex, we often find ourselves speeding up instead of facing the complexity, and the reason is generally “sounds better” is because our brains don’t have time to understand what’s going on, much like talking faster when we’re not feeling comfortable to cover up something.

### *“If you’re not feeling comfortable with feeling pain, you’ll believe everything that feels good”* 
*Surprise, it also applies to Music!*

Playing Slow is a nightmare, it’s like zooming in on what’s going only to see that everything’s a mess. It’s opening your eyes and noticing all the imperfections at once, it feels like a kid being extra proud of his ”amazing drawing” only to realize that it’s crap. The idea here is that **Playing Slow requires Confidence because it hurts to accept that we might not understand what’s going on**. If you manage to overcome this block that every human has, which is to face reality while trusting yourself. You’re on your way to developing an amazing mindset to Master the Ukulele. 

## Take away
- Playing Fast feels Easier than Playing Slow
- Playing Slow requires ”conscious braking like a car going downhill” 
- Playing Slow leaves space for the Silence
- Playing Slow allows your brain to notice all the little details
- Playing Slow is a requirement to Engaging the Senses
- Playing Slow is how you create the foundation to build up complexity
- Playing Slow is how you can feel how your shoulder’s doing today while also keeping a good rhythm
- Playing Slow is how you Learn
##### Most importantly
- Playing Slow is how you can become the Bob Ross of Ukulele

Don't always play slow, just play at different speeds
- Ultra slow: When you need that extra sharp focus
- Uncomfortable Slow: When you’re trying something new
- Normal Slow: How you naturally want to play
- Fast: Only remember why you should Play Slow
- Ultra ultra Fast: To explore the limits! 

I’ll add some recording to illustrate how one it works in practice.
