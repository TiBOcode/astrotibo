I insist, play slower


Few reasons why

Your play sucks

You play fast because you can't play slow

Playing fast gives you the illusion of playing well
- Playing slow will therefore sound worse

Only play fast if you can play it slow


Don't always play slow, just play at different speeds
Show example of speed
