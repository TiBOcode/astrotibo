Tabs are amazing, it‚Äôs like a magical guide to create musical wonders and you don‚Äôt even need to know solfege to read and play them. You just follow the instructions, spend some time practicing, making mistakes, repeating, going to sleep, practice some more‚Ä¶ and eventually you ‚Äùcan play a song‚Äù! 

Much like everyone else, when I first started the Ukulele I ended up scavenging for Tabs and quickly fell in love with a particular one, it was ‚ÄúComptine d‚Äôun autre √ât√©‚Äù by Yann Tiersen. It sounded amazing on Ukulele and became my favorite thing to play whenever there were people around and sometimes to myself as well. 

I played it for over a year, it was both the first song I learned and the last one I played, because I would eventually decide to give up on learning and playing from Tabs.

It was a tough decision. As I grew more serious about the Ukulele, I started to realize I could create my own music. I didn‚Äôt know so much about improvisation but I loved the freedom and creativity it offered, the ability to explore and express my own musical ideas, rather than just replicating someone else's.

One day I had what I thought was an amazing idea: ‚ÄúI love this ‚ÄôComptine d‚Äôun autre √©t√©‚Äô song so much, and I love improvising‚Ä¶ why not finding a way to merge both?‚Äú. The goal was simple: 
1. Improvise random things, 
2. Transition to the song 
3. Go back to improvising random things.
I couldn‚Äôt wait to try it, I stopped what I was doing and played the Ukulele. 

What happened? Not only did I not manage to do what I wanted, but the goal was completely out of reach. I realized that these 2 skills existed in 2 very different parts of my brain. Playing from the Tabs felt rigid, almost robotic, just following numbers and finger positions whereas improvisation was fluid, driven by listening and feeling. These two approaches seemed to exist in complete different parts of my brain, if felt like an entirely different skill set which made it nearly impossible to blend them smoothly.

It reminded me of a story I had heard about a classically trained pianist trying to learn Jazz Improvisation. She had spent 20 years of her life practicing piano, mastering difficult pieces. She was the definition of a talented musician, and we‚Äôd naturally expect her to be able to play anything. But when she tried to improvise, she found it nearly impossible and despite her incredible skills, the rigid structure of classical music had trained her brain in a way that made it difficult to break free. The transition from structured playing to improvisation was like learning an entirely new instrument.

This story resonated with me deeply because I realized I was facing a similar challenge. Playing from tabs, felt incredibly disconnected from the freedom I craved in my music. I tried a few more times to merge the structured world of tabs with the fluidity of improvisation, trying to force two incompatible elements together but without success.

It was a big moment of realization: I could either continue on the path of learning songs through tabs, or I could dive fully into improvisation, exploring and creating music that was truly mine. I chose the latter.

Over time, I noticed that I began to forget the tabs I once knew so well. *Comptine d‚Äôun autre √©t√©*, the song that I had loved so much to instead focus on something even more valuable: the ability to create music spontaneously, to express myself without the constraints of following someone else‚Äôs roadmap. Giving up on Tabs was far from easy and it ended up being a symbol of freedom for me. Now, playing the ukulele turned into telling my own story, my feelings in the present moment, made of all its musical imperfections and mistakes which makes a story authentic and real. That‚Äôs the beauty of playing music.
