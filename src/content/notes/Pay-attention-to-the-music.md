This is the kind of title that makes half of the people think "Of course that's so obvious!" and the other half "Wtf is that and why should I care?". Listening to the Music, means paying attention to it. It feels as easy to write it as it is to read it probably, but our hears, much like our other senses, are great at recognizing sounds we heard before because the way our brain filters and interprets sound waves is shaped by our [experiential development](/notes/experientialdevelopment), everything we sense is shaped & influenced by it too and if you want to become good *or better* at anything, you'll have to spend time fine tuning the most important of all your senses to Master Music, whether it's done unconsciously or consciously.


## Ear Training is like Torture, here’s how I trained mine

When I started adventuring the world by bike is when I also picked up Music, it was in 2020 and [📝my musical skills were terrible](/📝my musical skills were terrible). I had never played any music in my life before, I never even considered picking it up. It’s 2024 when I write these words, I’m now in the mountains wild camping with that same bike (a bit more rusty) and things have changed. I now have a great ear for improvising, not perfect, not absolute, but enough to hear and feel the music I play with enough depth to both enjoy it and resonate with it. 

I have tried Ear Training exercises, thinking it would help me develop my musical skills but I never managed to stick to it, I did notice some improvements here and there but it wasn’t the one thing that made the difference. 

### I stopped Practicing, I Played and Listened instead
A breakthrough I had was when I realize I struggled at hearing all the notes I was playing, I would hear the sound of the chords or just the melody but not much beyond that. 

# The more you spend time hearing the sound, the better you'll become
