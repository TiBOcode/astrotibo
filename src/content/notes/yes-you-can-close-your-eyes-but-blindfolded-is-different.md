Itâ€™s a fair point, but let me explain why I think simply closing your eyes and blindfolding yourself is very different. 

Ok, you donâ€™t see because your eyes are closed (duuuuh), but do you actually? In fact while you donâ€™t see much, thereâ€™s still light coming to your eyes, you can still orientate yourself based on the lightâ€™s direction and you still feel anchored into wherever and whenever you are.  

On the other hand, with a good blindfold you wonâ€™t see anything at all. But while this is an important aspect, it isnâ€™t the only reason why being blindfolded is different. There are 2 main reasons why:

## 1. Seeing isnâ€™t an option 
When you are blindfolded, **seeing is not an option**. Blindfolding yourself means giving up on sight completely, itâ€™s a place without conditions, you are blind and the only way to rely on vision again is to actively decide on removing the blindfold...and thatâ€™s what makes the difference! It forces your brain to accept that it will have to develop its other senses. Itâ€™s **the cold shower of mindfulness**, a practice that is as powerful as it is painful. 
It makes me remember that story of how musician in concentration camp 

## 2. Deeper  Immersion
In my own practice, I found it much **much** easier to flow in my own music when Iâ€™m blindfolded as opposed to just eyes closed. Itâ€™s easier to let go, to surrender to the sensory deprivation, it makes it easier to live the music, to focus on the moment, to notice the details, to be mindful in general.
