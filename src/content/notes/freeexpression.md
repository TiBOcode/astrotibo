title: Use Music as a tool for Self Discovery
---


I wish someone would have explained that to me when I started to play Music. **Music is a tool for Personal Growth & Discovery and not an end in itself.**

It means that Music stands along other Self Expression Practices like all kinds of Art: Drawing, Writing, Singing, Dancing, [Screaming](screaming)... anything that involves YOU EXPRESSING YOURSELF. It's a mean of communication and one that shouldn't be undermined, Â 

This approach to playing Music is for those who

## Different Approaches to Playing Music

People approach music-making for various reasons. Here are three common perspectives:

  
| Approach                 | Goal                              | Focus                                   | Mindset                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Professional Pursuit** | Financial success and recognition | Technical proficiency and marketability | "I want to use music to make money as a musician, so my goal is to play good music that appeals to a wide audience."                                 |
| **Social Connection**    | Bonding and shared experiences    | Enjoyment and collaboration             | "I want to use music to bond with friends and meet new people, so my goal is to play music that's fun and engaging in social settings."              |
| **Personal Growth**      | Self-discovery and expression     | Authenticity and emotional connection   | "I want to use music as a journey of self-discovery and growth, so my goal is to play in a way that feels authentic and emotionally resonant to me." |

  
## The Power of Personal Growth Through Music

  

While all approaches have their merits, the Personal Growth perspective offers unique benefits:

1. **Authenticity**: It encourages you to express your true self through music, rather than trying to fit a predetermined mold.
2. **Emotional Processing**: Music becomes a way to explore and understand your emotions, serving as a form of therapy.
3. **Lifelong Learning**: The focus shifts from achieving perfection to embracing continuous growth and discovery.
4. **Holistic Development**: Playing music this way can enhance other areas of life, improving self-awareness, creativity, and emotional intelligence.
5. **Intrinsic Motivation**: The reward comes from the process itself, not external validation, leading to a more sustainable and fulfilling practice.

When you approach music as a tool for self-discovery, you open up a world of possibilities. It's not about becoming the best performer or impressing others. It's about using music as a mirror to understand yourself better, as a canvas to express your innermost feelings, and as a path to personal growth.

Remember, there's no "right" way to play music. But if you're looking for a journey of self-discovery, emotional expression, and personal development, approaching music as a tool for growth can be incredibly rewarding.

So pick up that ukulele and play those strings,  let your feelings shine through. Your musical journey is uniquely yours: embrace it, explore it, and grow through it.
