*"This is something I'm constantly reflecting on, a fundamental value of mine. I'll be there in 20 years, maybe more."*

What does it mean to be Self-Less? 

I grew up in a world of ego, a world of status and of self-centered attention. Just like anyone else, I love when I'm suddenly the center of attention, when I'm being valued, seen, talked to. There's nothing like seeing people's eyes open up with surprise and joy at things I've done or said. But my 2 years traveling by bike taught me that this is a craving that I can overcome. 

It became clear to me that I'm a better person when I don't feel the need to show others who I am. 

# The Less "I Am", the More I Become.

My mission is to support others in their well intentioned dreams. There's a saying from the NGO world I love: "Help yourself first and then only help others". Over the last years I've found amazing value in working on myself, to understand who I am and what I really want. The less I focus on "Me", the more I can be for others. The less I need, the more I can give.

'Self-Less" means without ego, "Service" means supporting with intention and care. Together it becomes "Self-Less Service" which, in my own words mean: *Supporting others without expecting in return*


# What About Me?

Since 3 years now I feel very stable again. I'm driven and happy. I wake up everyday with a sense of duty, a genuine desire to study and help others. It's something I had never experienced before and it involved being satisfied with a simpler version of me. One that doesn't have to show others who he is (a bit less than usual at least) and one that learn the hard way through traveling & solitude, to develop inner Strength and Self Confidence.

These are things that would make older people smile, [most of these learnings come from learning to interact with them in my travels.](wiser-people)

Edit: Creating this blog is quite a thing for me; I used to write a lot without ever showing anything publicly and I didn't use any social media before I started both a Youtube channel and a blog with my own name. I'll try hard to stay down to earth as much as I can and make sure I read this note from time to time **to remember not Who I Am but Who I wanna Be**.
