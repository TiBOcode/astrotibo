| Stage                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| **Uninformed Optimism** | That's the excitement when you first pick up the Ukulele. You're thrilled and motivated at the idea of learning it. That's blind optimism, you're quite unaware of how complex this journey will be. |
| **Informed Pessimism**  | That's when you start understanding, the difficulties become apparent and the Optimism fades as you realize how much you suck, leading to doubts and frustration.                                    |
| **Valley of Despair**   | The lowest point where progress feels slow and playing becomes more challenging. **That's when most people stop playing**                                                                            |
| **Informed Optimism**   | That's when your head comes out of the water thanks to persistent practice, you start seeing progress but more importantly, you understand how to learn and you start to trust the process           |
| **Passion**             | The final stage where you feel accomplished and deeply connected to your new Passion. From there it only goes upward.                                                                                |
