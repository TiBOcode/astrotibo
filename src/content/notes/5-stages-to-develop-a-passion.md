| Stage                   | Description                                                                                                           | Explanation                                                                                   |

| **Uninformed Optimism** | That's the excitement when you first pick up the Ukulele. You're thrilled and motivated at the idea of learning it.   | That's Blind Optimism, you're quite unaware of how complex this journey will be.              |
| **Informed Pessimism**  | Problems only show up once you've started paying attention, you start facing your first difficulties.                 | The Blind Optimism fades as you realize how much you suck, leading to doubts and frustration. |
| **Valley of Despair**   | The lowest point where progress feels slow and playing becomes more challenging.                                      | **That's when most people stop playing**                                                      |
| **Informed Optimism**   | Thanks to persistent practice, you start seeing progress but more importantly.                                        | That's when you start understanding the process and to trust it.                              |
| **Passion**             | The final stage where you feel accomplished and deeply connected to your new Passion. From there it only goes upward. | Congratulations, you now have a Passion                                                       |
