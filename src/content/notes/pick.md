2Using a pick on a ukulele is kind of a meme, a bit of a joke in the Ukulele community. In reality, it‚Äôs not that you _can‚Äôt_ use a pick, but it‚Äôs definitely considered unusual.

## The Unique Strength of the Ukulele

The beauty of the ukulele lies in the texture, timbre, and percussive elements you can create with your fingers that create this warm, mellow sound. The Ukulele's identity is tied to fingerstyle playing. It's generally much easier to control these elements with your fingers

## Picks are great... on Guitar

On Guitars using a pick is almost a default choice for many and it makes sense! On any string instruments, using a pick gives you a more crystal-clear tone and brightness. The guitar has a more resonant sound which makes highlighting individual notes much more important than on the Ukulele


## Then there's the "Felt Pick" made for Ukulele

It‚Äôs designed to mimic the softer sound you get from fingerstyle playing while offering the convenience of a pick. It‚Äôs a clever idea, the marketing deserves some *clap clap* but it still remains a viable option if you really want to give it a try. 

The issue remains the same, you're stuck holding it and you can't play with 4 fingers anymore. Of course this is specific to the Approach I think is superior for specifically Improvising so I understand it might be appealing to some.

## The Solution from 4stringboy: The Felt Thumb Pick 

Then there's what 4stringboy uses, a Pick but attached to a ring on your thum, it offers a unique take on the idea of using a pick with a ukulele. He uses it because of a skin issue with his thumb but there probably are many of you out there with reasons to consider this one.
It may not be for everyone, but it‚Äôs worth exploring if you‚Äôre curious about different sounds and techniques. The learning curve might be steep at first but within a few months it should feel like an extension of you. 

*I never tried it, I like the creativity that fingers allow*

## Final Thoughts

Use your fingers
