Music is fascinating






I don't even know where to start. This will take me ages to write. Come back in a few years




Understanding what music is requires approaching it in many different context:

- Physics
	- Vibration
	- String instrument
- Biology
	- How do human perceive sound
	- How do animal perceive sound
- Psychology (neurolinguistic//communication)
	- Psychology of attention
	- Rhythm and Focus
	- Music as a Language
	- Bayesian Brain
	- Predictive Brain

Other stuff I don't know how to categorize yet;
- Practical use of Music
- Music in the animal kingdom (navigating and understanding the world through sound)
