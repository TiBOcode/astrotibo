What I want to teach is a unique approach to Fingerstyle Ukulele Improvisation.


The most important element in this particular style of improvisation are these repeating finger-picking patterns, minimal chord changes and a focus on personal enjoyment. That's what creates the basis of improvisation. It's all about providing a structure within which variations and creativity can be nested. It's the 📝[Structure that allows for Improvisation]()

# Simplicity & Accessibility
### Systemic Approach 
Left Hand-Right Hand Approach

Separating the roles of left and right hands in ukulele playing. 
- The left hand is responsible for forming chords and fingering notes
- The Right hand controls rhythm, strumming, and plucking patterns, allowing for clearer focus on each aspect of playing and improvisation
I'll write more here 📝[Left Hand vs Right Hand](left-hand-right-hand)


# **Mastering the Ukulele: Why You Should Play with Four Fingers**

### Four-Finger Approach:
Ukulele players often vary in their techniques, using anywhere from one to four fingers to play. [Some even opt for a pick](/notes/pick) (but these guys are strange). However, the most effective method is using four fingers, one for each string. 

I'll write some more about unlocking the fingers 📝[why and how to work on Finger Dexterity]().
I'll also link to my journey starting from 2 fingers, having to relearn to 3 fingers and a year later switching to 4 fingers (with a lot of difficulties)
