## Value First Approach

**"My goal isn’t to make money. My goal isn’t to become famous.  My goal is to give value to others in the pursuit of their well intentioned dreams. It means giving the tools and support for others to grow authentically."** 

We all want good for others (at least most of us) but we sometimes lose sight of this trying to fulfill our many desires. Taking care of myself physically and mentally to be able to give without expecting to receive.

That implies living a simple and minimalistic life in which I feel satisfied with the things I already have and be driven by well intentioned dreams (whatever this might mean). 

This is the philosophy behind all my content on the [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TiBO_Uke), [Patreon](patreon.md), Website (and life in general).
