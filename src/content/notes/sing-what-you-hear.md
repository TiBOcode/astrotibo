There's a famous Canadian pianist who was known for a very peculiar habit. He was known to "hum" or "sing" what he was playing on the piano to a degree that was pathological. His name was Glenn Gould.
I remember the first time I heard about him I thought "What a strange guy". Then time passed and when I picked up music myself, I started experimenting with this idea until I realized the real power of singing what you play.


# Why it makes sense
Now, I'm not telling that singing what you hear is going to turn anyone into an accomplished musician (whatever that means to you). It's just that, singing what you play makes a ton of sense to improve one's connection with music in many ways.

### Music & Speech in the Brain
First of all, Music is processed in very similar ways than speech in the brain. It's like if Music and Language were both made of sounds! (Oh...wait?). 
And lucky us, we might suck at Music, but we're extremely skilled at the later which is Language. 

The idea there is to link these amazing sound producing vocal chords we have to the skills of **Hearing and Playing Music.** <small style="color: grey;">(I insist on the "hearing part)"</small>

By connecting our vocal skills to hearing and playing music, we can leverage our linguistic abilities **to enhance our musical ones.**



# Explanation Made Simple

### Let's think about the practical way this is done:

---

|                                                   <big>1. Play some Music </big>                                                    |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| **<big>2. Listen to the Music you Create</big>**<br><small style="color: grey;"> [(oh! I wrote about that)](/notes/listen) </small> |
|            **<big>3. Sing it! </big>**<br><small style="color: grey;">(that's what we're learning to do now)</small><br>            |
|                 **<big>4. Listen to your own singing</big>**<br><small style="color: grey;"> 1. + 2. = 3. </small>                  |
|                                                                                                                                     |
|                                                    <big>**Feel & Repeat**</big>                                                     |

### My own experience doing that
I found it greatly improved the connection I have with my instrument as well as the connection with my own voice. Hearing my own voice in my head translated in being able to hear (more or less) music in my head in the same way. I wrote previously about how terrible my music skills were when I first started, which makes total sense because like many, I picked up music very late in life. And because of that, this kind of practice is even more powerful.

# Don't be ashamed
Now the hardest part is to not feel stupid. This practice is totally legit and the last thing that should hinder your progress is that Self Confidence 

### You don't need to sing well, you just need to sing
Here's the thing: you don't need to be "good" at singing to enjoy it. You just need to be good enough not to break windows or cause cats and dogs to escape in terror. Congratulations if you start experiment with it.

# Take it to the next level
Now, if you've found value in this note, here's a more challenging path to apply the same techniques and learn Ukulele Percussion
- [üìùBeatbox What You Play (seriously)](beatbox-what-you-play)



*Edit: Another surprise, I started singing! If my music skills were terrible, my singing skills were...non existent. Now, I wouldn't go for a career as a singer, but it seems that I can sing without making babies cry and more importantly, enjoy it*
