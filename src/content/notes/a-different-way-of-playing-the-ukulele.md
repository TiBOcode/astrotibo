I'm writing these words to attempt a summary of this new Approach to playing Ukulele. This is a special note because it is a temporary one. A note written to give sense by drawing the contour of what I'm teaching here and give a clearer vision as to what changes you can expect in the short term.

# Why Ukulele Fingerstyle Improvisation?


| **Ukulele ‚Üí**       | **[Because that's one of the best instruments to improvise on](/notes/theukulele)**     |
| :------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fingerstyle ‚Üí**   | **Because it's based on Ukulele Instrumental, [Singing is optional](/notes/song)**      |
| **Improvisation ‚Üí** | **üìù[Because it's the gateway to Musical Freedom and Self-Expression](/improvisation)** |

# How to Teach it? 

### By Making it Simple
Simple because it's an approach focused on Simplicity & Accessibility. That means that the foundation of the Playstyle itself is fairly basic, relying on simple finger patterns, minimal chord change and a focus on repetition.

### By Teaching it in a Novel Way
If you're reading these words, you're probably already familiar with the animations I create myself. Alongside this blog, I'm working on a set of new tools to revolutionize the way we learn the Ukulele. Allowing people to learn the Art of Improvising, which until now, had very limited & low quality resources.

### By Someone that Learned through Frustration
I'm the one working on all aspects of the content creation and what drives me is that I've learned Ukulele Improvisation on my own too. I'm a self taught "musician" <small>(whatever that means)</small> and I know the struggles associated with learning Ukulele this way. 

# How it Started

Back in December 2023, I uploaded a video named "A Different Way to Play the Ukulele" and it was the first time I ever recorded myself talking this way, let alone upload anything on YouTube. Surprisingly, it caught the attention of many and now has 2.2k views at the time of writing. The next one "Quick tips to improvise at home" gathered 8.6k views which is ridiculously high for this kind of content.

I now know I'm not the only one who's passionate about this Art of Self Expression in Music, I aim at fostering change around the way it's being transmitted. Whether you're a total beginner or an experienced musical explorer, you're welcome to join the adventure. This is only the beginning.


Thank you.
