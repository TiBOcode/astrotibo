# Why should you learn how to improvise?

### Here's what Wikipedia tells us:
:::info
In music, improvisation is the art of playing an instrument (or singing) in which the musician or musicians make up the music as they play.
Improvising means giving space for spontaneous creation over simple repetition of existing pieces.

It's a great start but it carries a lot of myths, some of which are causing people (including me only a few years ago) to think that they are not capable of improvising music because they aren‚Äôt talented or didn‚Äôt receive musical education starting from age 5.

### 1. Pleasure Centered Approach



###### Let me propose a new definition:

Improvisation is the art of creatively exploring music **in the moment**, by combining learned skills with personal expression. It's accessible to all, **regardless of age** or **formal training**, and **it can be practiced at any level**. Improvisation involves [üìùplaying with music as opposed to playing music](üìùplayingwithmusic.md)


It's not about perfection, but about the joy of musical discovery and self-expression.

You can learn how to improvise much quicker than you think, as long as you have the right mindset to practice.
