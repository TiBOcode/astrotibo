A non linear website is an interconnected network of content rather than a traditional hierarchical structure.
 
Here's the deal: Our brain doesn't work like a textbook. It jumps around, makes weird connections, and sometimes learns best when you're not trying too hard. Sounds familiar? 

 not only there to avoid that issue but also **take advantage** of that same idea. It's a web of interconnected notes, each note representing an idea and connects to other related ideas.  

# 1. Freedom to Explore

You are in control of what you want to read. Just follow what grabs your interest and click around. Read, think, explore and let your curiosity be your guide. You might be surprised where you end up and what connections you make along the way.

# 2. There's no "right or wrong" Path

Learning is everywhere. Letting go of expectation and trusting the process is what will allow you to learn the most from where you expect it the least. Especially when you're in the [uninformed optimism phase of your learning journey](/notes/guidelearning). 


### Where you expect to learn is not where you'll learn the most

# 3. Embrace getting lost, because you will. 

Now that you are warned, you will still feel lost, but *go for it, explore and come back*. The moment you feel lost are perhaps the same moments you learn the most. Embrace the surprise behind the uncertainty, build confidence in your ability to navigate this maze and extract knowledge for yourself. You're on your way to master one of the most powerful tool for learning.
