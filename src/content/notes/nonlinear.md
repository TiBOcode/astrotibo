# What's a non linear website? 
Here's the deal: Our brain doesn't work like a textbook. It jumps around, makes weird connections, and sometimes learns best when you're not trying too hard. Sounds familiar?

A non linear website is there to not only avoid that issue but also **take advantage** of that same idea. It's a web of interconnected notes, each note representing an idea and connects to other related ideas.  

### There's no "right or wrong" Path
Much like while improvising on the Ukulele, you are in control of what you want to read. Just follow what grabs your interest. Click around, explore and let your curiosity be your guide. You might be surprised where you end up and what connections you make along the way.
