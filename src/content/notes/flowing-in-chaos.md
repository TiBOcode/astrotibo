Here I'd like to talk about the idea of Flowing in Chaos, the idea that life is a lifelong journey (what a joke!) that can take many turns (and certainly will!).

### Life is a Paradox between Comfort and Chaos

Comfort is stable and relaxing, it's the taste of a good life well lived
Chaos is the complete opposite, it's the taste of a life of adventure and discovery

It's easy to Flow in Comfort, but Flowing in Chaos is a completely different thing.

To me, Learning to Flow in Chaos means learning to feel Comfortable in the midst of Discomfort, learning to manage emotions in a way that makes life both interesting and happy. 

It's about learning how to feel safe anywhere, how to trust the world by learning it's every facets. Throwing one's self in the Chaos just to come back stronger.

I'm not particularly strong, I'm not particularly unique, I'm just living a different life. I live on a bike with the bare minimum, homeless for some, adventurer for others. I'm just being and living a life of Chaos, a life that I enjoy living, and I'm striving to Flow in it.
